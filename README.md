Avoid accidentally moving mouse to/from secondary displays.

I recently added another monitor to my computer and it was really annoying when mouse moved to the other display when I was only moving it close to the edge.

I saw in Ubuntu that it sticks the mouse to the edge between displays for a while when quickly moved to the edge.

This utility does the similar.
